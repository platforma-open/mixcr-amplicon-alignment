# Overview

The MiXCR Amplicon Alignment block analyzes amplicon sequencing data for immune receptor repertoire profiling using MiXCR software.

## What it does

This block processes amplicon sequencing data (FASTA/FASTQ files) to:

1. **Generate Reference Libraries**: Creates custom V and J gene reference libraries
2. **Run MiXCR Analysis**: Performs generic-amplicon analysis chain types
3. **Quality Control**: Produces alignment and assembly quality reports
4. **Export Data**: Generates clone sets, TSV exports, and processing logs

## Key Features

- Supports multiple chain types (IG Heavy/Light, TCR Alpha/Beta/Gamma/Delta)
- Custom V and J gene library support
- Comprehensive quality metrics and reports
